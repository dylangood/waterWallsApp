# waterWallsApp
App that solves &amp; visualizes various Water Walls-types of toy problems

## Getting Started
I'm probably going to grow this app's capabilities as I encounter more problems like this.
I've noticed there are lots of subtly different versions of it, so it seems like a whole genre.
But for now I just want acknowledge my starting point.

### I started from this React boilerplate:
https://github.com/kyle-wilson/react-webpack-starter
### I used a private repo from a backend problem I did for a company a couple months ago.
{ this-space-intentionally-left-blank: null }
### I also had a useful function I worked on a couple weeks ago:
