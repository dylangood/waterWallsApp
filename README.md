# waterWallsApp
App that solves &amp; visualizes various Water Walls-types of toy problems

## Getting Started
To get started, first just clone the repo & npm install.
From there, you can use "npm start" to activate webpack for automated transpiling.
Use "npm run server" to turn on the Node server & monitor for changes.
To see what the app does, type a comma-separated list of integers into the *input*, then click the *button*.

### I started from this React boilerplate:
https://github.com/kyle-wilson/react-webpack-starter
### I used the server I built for a backend problem I solved a couple months ago.
{ this-space-intentionally-left-blank: null }
### I also had a useful function I worked on a couple weeks ago:

## Notes:
I'm probably going to grow this app's capabilities as I encounter more problems like this.
I've noticed there are lots of subtly different versions of it, so it seems like a whole genre.
But for now I just want acknowledge my starting point.
